# Stadia-ViGEm

Xbox 360 controller emulation for Stadia controller. Supports multiple devices and vibration. Forked from Mi-ViGEm (https://github.com/grayver/Mi-ViGEm) by grayver.
Xbox 360 emulation driver is provided by ViGEm (https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus), by Benjamin HÃ¶glinger.

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (should work on Windows 7 and 8 also)
- ViGEm bus installed (can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases))

Notice for Windows 11: Vibration might not works with your controller. 

## How it works

Stadia-ViGEm program at start scans for Stadia Controllers and then proxies found Stadia Controllers to virtual Xbox 360 gamepads (with help from ViGEmBus). Also Stadia-ViGEm subscribes to system device plug/unplug notifications and rescans for devices on each notification.
All found devices are displayed in the tray icon context menu. Manual device rescan can be initiated via the tray icon context menu.

### Running at Startup

To run at Windows startup:

1. Right click on the `.exe` -> Create shortcut
2. Copy / Cut the shortcut
3. Navigate to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
4. Paste the shortcut

## Double input

Stadia-ViGEm creates a virtual Xbox 360 controller which results in double input issues when some applications will read input from both the virtual and the real Stadia controller. To avoid this, install [HidHide](https://github.com/ViGEm/HidHide) and configure it as follows:
 - Open HidHide Configuration Client
 - On Applications tab:
   - Click "+" button
   - Browse to the Stadia-ViGEm executable you normally use (Stadia-ViGEm-x86.exe or Stadia-ViGEm-x64.exe)
 - On Devices tab:
   - Tick box next to the Stadia controller entry (my controller is named as "Google LLC Stadia Controller rev. A")
   - Tick "Enable device hiding" at the bottom of the window
 - Reboot your PC

After this, only Stadia-ViGEm will be able to see the real controller. Note: This means that whenever Stadia-ViGEm isn't running, the controller will not be able to control anything on your PC.

## Double input problem
Mi-ViGEm doesn't replace Xiaomi gamepad with XBox360 gamepad, it just creates virtual XBox360 gamepad in parallel, so both gamepads are presented in OS. This causes problems in some games, which read input from both real and virtual gamepads. There is nothing to do with that on user application level, only kernel level driver can help. Fortunately, ViGEm developed HidHide driver which deals with that problem (can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ViGEm/HidHide/releases)).

Mi-ViGEm provides integration with HidHide driver since version 1.2. It automatically detects HidHide presence and makes necessary changes in white and black lists. You only need to install HidHide (reboot is required) and run Mi-ViGEm.
